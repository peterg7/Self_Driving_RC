\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 Self Driving RC Car
\b0\fs24 \
\
This project used a raspberry pi, arduino, and laptop computer to enable an \'93off-the-shelf\'94 RC car to drive autonomously. \
\

\b\fs28 Hardware:
\b0\fs24 \
-Raspberry  Pi Model B\
-Arduino Mega\
-Kids RC Car\
-Apple Laptop\
-Ultrasonic Sensor ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13959"}}{\fldrslt HC-SR04}})\
\

\b\fs28 Contents:
\b0\fs24 \
\ul neural_net\ulnone : contains all programs relating to the neural network. \
	-neural_network.py: small scale implementation of a neural network, used for conceptual 	purposes\
	-collect_data.py: while the user manually operates the car, this program saves the user\'92s input 	as well as the video stream \
	-mlp_training.py: loads the data saved by collect_data.py and uses it to train the neural 	network\
	-mlp_test.py: test the trained neural network and its ability to predict commands based upon 	the video stream\
	-miscellaneous directories for storing data\
\
\ul tests:\ulnone  contains all test programs\
	-camera_test.py: initial test program for using Hough Lines from opencv to detect lines 	observed from a live camera\
	-car_control.py: enables the user to use the keyboard to send real-time commands to the 	arduino and then through the remote to the car\
	-distance_server.py: tests the TCP connection between the laptop and raspberry pi. streams 	data from the ultrasonic sensor from the pi to the host computer\
\
\ul arduino\ulnone : contains the necessary program to be flashed to the arduino\
	-rc_control.ino: sets up the arduino to be able to receive serial commands form the host 	computer \
\
\ul raspberry_pi\ulnone :\
	-ultrasonic_client.py: client program for the raspberry pi to package up ultrasonic data and 	send it to the host computer\
	-video_client.py: client program to package the video stream on the raspberry pi and send it to 	the host computer\
\
\ul driver.py\ulnone : main file for the project. must first run collect_data.py and mlp_training.py before executing 	this program. raspberry pi must have both client programs running (ultrasonic_client.py & 	video_client.py). arduino must be flashed with rc_control.ino and connected to a serial port. \
